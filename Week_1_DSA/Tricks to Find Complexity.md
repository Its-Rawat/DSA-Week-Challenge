```
Example 3: -> This program has time complexity as O(n)
```

```
Example 4: -> This Program has time complexity of O(n/2) + O(1) = O(n)
Removed 1/2 as they are just constant
```

```
Example 5 -> This has complexity of O(n) * O(m) = O(n^2)
```
# ![[Pasted image 20241016121809.png]]

```
Example 6: -> In this time complexity is O(n/2) --> O(n) after removeing Constants
```

```
Example 7: -> In this complexity is O(n) * O(n)  = O(n^2)
```

```
Example 8: -> In this Complexity is O(n log n)
